# 📘 Diabetes Prediction — Model Development Journey (3-Stage Progression)

A complete end-to-end evolution from baseline → EDA-driven improvements → advanced engineered final model.

## 🧠 Project Overview

This repository documents my complete modelling workflow for predicting **diagnosed diabetes** using structured health, lifestyle, and demographic data.

Across **three iterations**, the model evolves from a simple baseline to a highly engineered, drift-corrected, competition-ready **XGBoost pipeline**.
